abstract = {GRASP is a multi-start metaheuristic for combinatorial optimization problems, in which each iteration consists basically of two phases: construction and local search. The construction phase builds a feasible solution, whose neighborhood is investigated until a local minimum is found during the local search phase. The best overall solution is kept as the result. In this chapter, we first describe the basic components of GRASP. Successful implementation techniques are discussed and illustrated by numerical results obtained for different applications. Enhanced or alternative solution construction mechanisms and techniques to speed up the search are also described: alternative randomized greedy construction schemes, Reactive GRASP, cost perturbations, bias functions, memory and learning, local search on partially constructed solutions, hashing, and filtering. We also discuss implementation strategies of memory-based intensification and post-optimization techniques using path-relinking. Hybridizations with other metaheuristics, parallelization strategies, and applications are also reviewed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the development of a Greedy Random Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) where two low-level graph heuristics, Saturation Degree (SD) and Largest Weighted Degree (LWD) are dynamically hybridised in the construction phase to construct solutions for exam timetabling problems. The problem is initially solved using an intelligent adaptive LWD and SD graph hyper-heuristic which constructs the restricted can-didate list (RCL) in the first phase of GRASP. It is observed that the size of the RCL used in each iteration affects the quality of the results obtained. In addition, the SD heuristic is es-sential to construct a RCL which leads to a feasible solution. However, SD does not perform well at the early stages of the construction. Therefore, LWD is used until a certain switch-ing point is reached. The hyper-heuristic adaptively determines the size of the RCL in each iteration and the best switching point after evaluating the quality of the solutions produced. In the improvement phase of GRASP, it is observed that tabu search slightly improves the constructed solutions when compared to steepest descent but it takes a longer time. The ap-proach adapts to all the benchmark problems tested. The comparison of this approach with state-of-the-art approaches indicates that it is a simple yet efficient technique. The results also indicate that the technique could adapt itself to construct good quality solutions for any timetabling problem with similar constraints.},

abstract = {The high school timetabling is a classical combinatorial optimization problem that takes a large number of variables and constraints into account. Due to its combinatorial nature, solving medium and large instances to optimality is a challenging task. When resources are tight, it is often difficult to find even a feasible solution. Among the different requirements that are considered in Brazilian schools, two compactness requirements must be met on a teachers schedule: the minimization of working days and the avoidance of idle timeslots. In this paper, we present a mixed integer linear programming model and a fix-and-optimize heuristic combined with a variable neighborhood descent method. Our method uses three different types of decompositions - class, teacher and day - in order to solve the high school timetabling problem. The method is able to find new best known solutions for seven instances, including three optimal ones. A comparison with results reported in the literature shows that the proposed fix-and-optimize heuristic outperforms state-of-the-art techniques for the resolution of the problem at hand.},

abstract = {Building university timetables is a complex process that considers varying types of constraints and objectives from one institution to another. The problem solved in this paper is a real one featuring a number of hard and soft constraints that are not very conventional. The pursued objective is also novel and considers maximizing resource utilization. This paper introduces a genetic algorithm that uses some heuristics to generate an initial population of feasible good quality timetables. The algorithm uses a simple weighted sum formula to respect professors' preferences and handle conflicts. In order to reduce waste, a crossover type focusing on the utilization rates of learning spaces is introduced. A targeted mutation operator that uses a local search heuristic is also employed. The algorithm applies a composite fitness function that considers space utilization, gaps between events and a maximum number of lectures per day. A large dataset with real data from the Faculty of Commerce, Alexandria University in Egypt was used to test the contributed algorithm. The algorithm was also tested against two difficult benchmark problems from the literature. Testing proved that the developed algorithm is an effective tool for managing timetables and resources in universities. It performed remarkedly well on the large datasets of the two benchmark problems and it also respected more constraints than those stated in the initial problem statement of the two benchmark datasets.},

abstract = {University course timetabling is concerned with assigning a set of courses to a set of rooms and timeslots according to a set of constraints. This problem has been tackled using metaheuristics techniques. Artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm has been successfully used for tackling uncapaciated examination and course timetabling problems. In this paper, a novel hybrid ABC algorithm based on the integrated technique is proposed for tackling the university course timetabling problem. First of all, initial feasible solutions are generated using the combination of saturation degree (SD) and backtracking algorithm (BA). Secondly, a hill climbing optimizer is embedded within the employed bee operator to enhance the local exploitation ability of the original ABC algorithm while tackling the problem. Hill climbing iteratively navigates the search space of each population member in order to reach a local optima. The proposed hybrid ABC technique is evaluated using the dataset established by Socha including five small, five medium and one large problem instances. Empirical results on these problem instances validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Our work also shows that a well-designed hybrid technique is a competitive alternative for addressing the university course timetabling problem. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

We have concentrated upon university timetabling but we believe that some of the methodologies that are described can be used for different timetabling problems such as employee timetabling, timetabling of sports fixtures, etc. The paper suggests a number of approaches and comprises three parts. Firstly, recent heuristic and evolutionary timetabling algorithms are discussed. In particular, two evolutionary algorithm developments are described: a method for decomposing large real-world timetabling problems and a method for heuristic initialisation of the population. Secondly, an approach that considers timetabling problems as multicriteria decision problems is presented. Thirdly, we discuss a case-based reasoning approach that employs previous experience to solve new timetabling problems. Finally, we outline some new research ideas and directions in the field of timetabling. The overall aim of these research directions is to explore approaches that can operate at a higher level of generality than is currently possible. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The most complete form of academic timetabling problem is the population and course timetabling problem. In this problem, there may be multiple classes of each subject, and the decision on which students are to constitute each class is made in concert with the decision on the timetable for each class. In order to solve this problem, it is normally simplified or decomposed in some fashion. One simplification commonly used in practice is known as blocking: it is assumed that the classes can be partitioned into sets of classes (or blocks) that will be timetabled in parallel. This restricts clashing to occur only between classes in the same block, and essentially removes the timetabling aspect of the problem, which can be carried out once the blocks are constituted and the classes populated. The problem of constituting the blocks and populating the classes, known as the course blocking and population problem, is nevertheless a challenging problem, and provides the focus of this paper. We demonstrate, using data provided by a local high school, that integer linear programming approaches can solve the problem in a matter of seconds. Key features include remodelling to remove symmetry caused by students with identical subject selection, and the observation that in practice, only integrality of the block composition variables needs to be enforced; the class population aspects of the model have strong integrality properties.},

abstract = {Integer programming has always been an alternative for formulating combinatorial problems such as the university timetabling problem. However, the effort required for modeling complicated operational rules, as well as the computational difficulties that result from the size of real problems have discouraged researchers and made them turn their interest to other approaches. In this paper, a two-stage relaxation procedure that solves efficiently the integer programming formulation of a university timetabling problem is presented. The relaxation is performed in the first stage and concerns the constraints that warrantee consecutiveness in multi-period sessions of certain courses. These constraints, which are computationally heavier than the others, are recovered during the second stage and a number of sub-problems, one for each day of the week, are solved for local optima. Comparing to a solution approach that solves the problem in a single stage, computation time is reduced significantly without any loss in quality for the resulting timetables. The new solution approach gives a chance for further improvements in the final timetables, as well as for certain degree of interaction with the users during the construction of the timetables. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A novel 0–1 integer programming formulation of the university timetabling problem is presented. The model provides constraints for a great number of operational rules and requirements found in most academic institutions. Treated as an optimization problem, the objective is to minimize a linear cost function. With this objective, it is possible to consider the satisfaction of expressed preferences regarding teaching periods or days of the week or even classrooms for specified courses. Moreover, with suitable definition of the cost coefficients in the objective function it is possible to reduce the solution space and make the problem tractable. The model is solvable by existing software tools with IP solvers, even for large departments. The case of a five-year Engineering Department with a large number of courses and teachers is presented along with its solution as resulted from the presented IP formulation.},

abstract = {In this contribution we present the application of a hybrid cat swarm optimization (CSO) based algorithm for solving the school timetabling problem. This easy to use, efficient and fast algorithm is a hybrid variation of the classic CSO algorithm. Its efficiency and performance is demonstrated by conducting experiments with real-world input data. This data, collected from various high schools in Greece, has also been used as test instances by many other researchers in their publications. Results reveal that this hybrid CSO based algorithm, applied to the same school timetabling test instances using the same evaluation criteria, exhibits better performance in less computational time compared to the majority of other existing approaches, such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs), Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), Simulated Annealing (SA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Fish Swarm (AFS). The algorithm's main process constitutes a variation of the classic CSO algorithm, properly altered so as to be applied for solving the school timetabling problem. This process contains the main algorithmic differences of the proposed approach compared to other algorithms presented in the respective literature.},

The XHSTT format was adopted in this work because it models the main features of educational timetabling and it is the most used format in recent studies in the field. This work presents new cuts and reformulations for the existing integer programming model for XHSTT. The proposed cuts improved hugely the linear relaxation of the formulation, leading to an average gap reduction of 32{\%}. Applied to XHSTT-2014 instance set, the alternative formulation pro-vided four new best known lower bounds and, used in a matheuristic framework, improved eleven best known solutions. The computational experiments also show that the resulting integer programming mod-els from the proposed formulation are more effectively solved for most of the instances.},

abstract = {College timetabling is a combinatoric and dynamic problem. In order to solve this problem, the approach must be efficient, flexible, portable, and adaptable. This paper describes a solution procedure based on a constraint-based reasoning technique implemented in an object-oriented approach. The problem is formulated as a constraint satisfaction model and it is then solved using the proposed algorithm. The algorithm is tested using real data from one of the colleges offering professional courses. The results show that a 18-weeks timetable for 1673 subject sections, 10 rooms, 21 lecturers can be solved in less than 33 minutes as compared to several weeks if it is to be solved manually. Since it is implemented using the object-oriented approach, the proposed system can also be modified and easily adapted to support changes. Scope and purpose Timetable planning is an activity of assigning subjects to time and space such that all constraints are satisfied. It can be categorized into several types and the most common types are academic (in universities, colleges, and schools), airline, and nurse timetablings. Constraint-based reasoning is a problem-solving technique that combines logic programming and constraint-solving technique based on an arc-consistency algorithm. It has been used to solve constraint satisfaction problems. The purpose of the paper is to present the modeling process of the college timetabling as a constraint satisfaction problem. The model is then solved using the constraint-based reasoning approach. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In this problem, one of the most important issues is variety of constraints, which results in different ways of timetabling in different universities. Comparing to exact methods which take lots of time to solve UCTP, metaheuristic methods produce a feasible solution within reasonable computation time. In this paper, a hybrid method is presented, which is based on combination of improved Memetic and Simulated Annealing Algorithms. Using Simulated Annealing Algorithm as the local search routine increases exploiting ability of Memetic Algorithm. Also, modifying Crossover operator of Memetic Algorithm and creating initial population by a beuristic-based method improves this algorithm. In order to improve produced chromosomes and decreasing the number of violation of the constraints, a new operator is designed and added to Memetic Algorithm called improvement operator. With comparing the results of this method and some modern methods using standard data, efficiency of this method is clear.},

First, a graph-based heuristic is used to construct a feasible solution of the relaxed problem, and then, a simulated annealing (SA)-based approach is utilized to minimize the violation of the soft constraint. In order to strengthen the diversification ability of the method in the SA phase, a heuristic based on Kempe chain neighborhood is embedded into the standard approach. This strategy is tested on a well-known data set, and the results are very competitive compared to the current state of the art of the UCTP.},

Different heuristic approaches have been proposed in order to solve this kind of problem in the literature. One of the efficient solution methods for this problem is tabu search. Different neighborhood structures based on different types of move have been defined in studies using tabu search. In this paper, the effects of moves called simple and swap on the operation of tabu search are examined based on defined neighborhood structures. Also, two new neighborhood structures are proposed by using the moves called simple and swap.

abstract = {University course timetabling problem (UCTP) is considered to be a hard combinatorial optimization problem to assign a set of events to a set of rooms and timeslots. Although several methods have been investigated, due to the nature of UCTP, memetic computing techniques have been more effective. A key feature of memetic computing is the hybridization of a population-based global search and the local improvement. Such hybridization is expected to strike a balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space. In this paper, a memetic computing technique that is designed for UCTP, called the hybrid harmony search algorithm (HHSA), is proposed. In HHSA, the harmony search algorithm (HSA), which is a metaheuristic population-based method, has been hybridized by: 1) hill climbing, to improve local exploitation; and 2) a global-best concept of particle swarm optimization to improve convergence. The results were compared against 27 other methods using the 11 datasets of Socha et al. comprising five small, five medium, and one large datasets. The proposed method achieved the optimal solution for the small dataset with comparable results for the medium datasets. Furthermore, in the most complex and large datasets, the proposed method achieved the best results. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]},
